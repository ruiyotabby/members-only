# README

In this project, I worked to implement authentication systems so users can only access areas of a site they are authorized to. I built an exclusive clubhouse where members can write anonymous posts. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.
